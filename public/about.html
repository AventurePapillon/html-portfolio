<h1>About Avery</h1>
<p>Avery is expanding her knowlege by learning about computer 
  programing. This is a completely new skill and this endeavor has 
  shown her how much she can learn but also how much she has yet to obtain.
  She has a background in Fashion and Costume Design and the creative
  output of computer programing is exciting. She is also quite analytical and 
  logical. So the straight forward (if she dare say that) formula's of
  coding are satisfying. Challenging to remeber but logical.

<p>This particular project was a challenge. It proved to be harder 
  than she thought. Having to put her thinking cap on she reviewed
  her notes, made educated guesses, researched, and tested until she 
  came to this final result.
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little project of hers. One tiny example
  of what is yet to come. To build functioning and beautiful websites
  is the goal. A hard but rewarding task she has set upon herself. 
  Let's see what else she can do.
